# Chest-X-ray-Classification-using-pytorch
This project focuses on developing a robust Deep Learning model using PyTorch for the automatic classification of Chest X-ray images. The primary goal is to accurately distinguish between multiple pathologies from X-ray scans, leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to aid in medical diagnosis.
